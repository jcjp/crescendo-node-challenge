# Node Coding Challenge

To run this application you need to run `npm start` make sure that node is installed on your machine.

This app is made using Node.JS and Express-Generator. Use axios, cheerio and puppeter to achieve the requirements.

The only modified endpoint is `/yelp` add your yelp url after /yelp like this `?url=https://www.yelp.com/biz/spiral-pasay-2` or use `/yelp` only to see how it works.
